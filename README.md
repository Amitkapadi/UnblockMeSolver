UnblockMeSolver
===============

An auto-solver I coded for the "Unblock Me" puzzle game.

[Extensive blog post about it is here](http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/unblock.html) (also,
mirrored [here](http://ttsiodras.github.com/unblock.html)).

Use "make test" to see it in action (the Makefile uses ImageMagick to convert the image data into RGB files, so you need to install it first).
